<h1>Reaction to the Floating Sheep Manifesto</h1>
<p>I position myself more as a cartographer and a little bit critique, I have never even thought or dealt with code in my mapping days.  The maps I produce are used by governmental agencies and the general public for geologic knowledge of a specified area.  I also look at other geologic maps and think how they can be better or what knowledge I can gain from them to make my maps perform or look better.  As I move along in my career, I will try to think more of how the user, looks and uses the maps I produce.  This writing makes me think more of how my maps will be used or how they are looked at from the general public and by other cartographers, not just other geologists.</p>
<p>One of the points that I have to think about every time I map, is 5b from the manifesto “But not everything can (or should) be mapped.” I deal with this line of thinking every day, as I have to think in terms of the scale of the map.  Can I accurately depict this geological feature on a 1:24,000 scale map? If I can, then I will put it on the map.  If I cannot make a polygon or line of the feature on the map, is it important enough to make a separate point on the map or include it in the text of the map?  The manifesto brings up several good points that occur with the cartographer, but may not be realized as we get caught up in the production of the map.</p>
